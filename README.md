# HexaDynamic - A Blender Geometry Nodes Animation

## Project Overview

videoGFX.mp4 (not changing the name hmph) is a visual animation created using Blender geometry nodes. It showcases a landscape of hexagons and 2d grass with colorful lights yay. This project was for exhibiting the capabilities of procedural generation and the power of computer graphics for creating visual environments.

The project is part of a exploration into computer graphics, and serves as a testament to the learning and application of various tools and concepts within Blender.

## Graphics-Based Technologies

This project is built using:

- **Geometry Nodes**: A node-based system for procedural creation and transformation of geometrical shapes.
- **Shaders**: Using Blender's shader system to create visually appealing materials and textures that respond to light and the environment.
- **Drivers**: Utilizing Blender's drivers to automate complex animations.
- **Value Keying**: Implementing value keying to smoothly transition properties over time.

This website is hosted using:

- **Firebase Hosting**: A web application written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Blender-generated media files.
- **Deployment**: Using Firebase CLI tools.

These technologies come together to form an animation that is not only a piece of art but also an educational tool for understanding the depths of Blender's capabilities.
